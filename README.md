# VR-FarmDay

This work was made by Ana Rojo Agustí and Rodrigo García Carmona. This project is a fork of [VRTK](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/VRTK)
and it uses its API and the sample scenario extensively.

This is a set of six activities of daily living, designed for the rehabilitation of patients with upper limb disorders. More details are
provided in the paper linked bellow, in the "Citation" section.
